# Portfolio Template — MD Afnan Hossan

This is a lightweight, responsive portfolio template. Files included:

- `index.html` — main page
- `style.css` — styling (dark, responsive)
- `script.js` — contact form handling + projects loader from your Worker API

## How to use

1. Upload these files to your GitHub Pages repo root (you already have `index.html`).
2. Edit `script.js` and set `WORKER_API_URL` to your Cloudflare Worker base URL (e.g. `https://afnan-portfolio-api.mdafnahossan1.workers.dev`).
3. If your messages endpoint requires an admin password, put it into `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HEADER` (or change the code for public messages).
4. Commit and push. Pages should publish automatically.

## Notes

- Replace placeholder text, image and the "Sample Project" with your real content.
- If you want, I can customize this template with your real bio, projects, images and colors.
